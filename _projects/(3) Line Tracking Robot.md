description: For my third year Mechatronics design project, we has to develop a line tracking robot car! It made use of motors to rotate the wheels, infra-red sensors designed and tested by us and the STM32F0 microprocessor. This was a fun experience and I believe we learned a lot of valuable information from electronic circuit design to algorithm design.

# Line Tracking Robot
Executed by a team of four individuals. The robot was designed from first principles, which included the design of sensor circuitry, microcontroller circuitry, the physical chassis as well as the line sensing firmware.
