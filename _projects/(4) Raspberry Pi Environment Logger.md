# Environment Logger
Using the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as the main processor, the objective of the project was to mimic a greenhouse monitoring system that logs environmental conditions such as light, humidity and temperature. The system also implemented IoT by connecting to oneâ€™s phone via the Blynk App, which made it possible to monitor the greenhouse remotely.

The implemented circuit can be seen in the image below, the components included 4 push buttons, an MCP3008 ADC, a temperature sensor and a light dependent resistor. For more detail, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/marrrk/EEE3096/tree/master/ProjectA/src">code repository</a>  and/or the <a href="/assets/pdfs/ProjectA_Report_MKGPUL005_NJRMAR003.pdf">Final Report</a>.
